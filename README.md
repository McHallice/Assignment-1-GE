Project Description:

For my Assignment I have decided to attempt to code proceduarlly generated terrain. I will attempt to complete this by using pseudorandom noise to generate a height map and then choose terrain types according the the height. 

For my references I looked at previous projects and saw one that had to do with landscapes as well. 
I also viewed the procedural generation forum on reddit(1)
